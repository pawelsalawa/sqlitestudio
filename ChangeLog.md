# ChangeLog

### 3.4.5
- ADDED: #4974 Extension-based collations (like the ICU) can be now registered in databases using Collations Editor window.
- ADDED: #5041 Added support for column list syntax in CREATE VIEW.
- ADDED: #4774 Added checking if data types are matched in both columns while creating foreign column. This applies for Column Dialog Foreign Key, Table Foreign Key and also in the Query Executor (user will receive warning if executed query breaks the Foreign Key data type alignment).

- CHANGE: #4740 Dialog geometry is saved & restored for several dialog windows (i.e. Import, Export, Populate and more...).
- CHANGE: #4861 When loading SQL script into SQL Editor, contents of current editor are retained. Instead another editor is open to load SQL script, with exception when current editor is empty - in that case it is used for loading.
- CHANGE: #4861 When trying to load SQLite database as SQL script into SQL Editor window, application detects it and opens Database dialog for that file instead.

- BUGFIX: #4844 Fixed moving/copying Views from one base to another using drag&drop or copy&paste.
- BUGFIX: #4861 Fixed application freezing when loading big files into SQL editor (over 1MB or bigger). Now it can work with huge files, although all smart helpers (e.g. syntax highlighting, etc) are disabled in such window.
- BUGFIX: #4872 Fixed executing SQL directly from file, so it does not skip CREATE TRIEGGER statements.
- BUGFIX: #4871 Fixed executing SQL directly from file, so it no longer disables foreign key checks during execution.
- BUGFIX: #4874 Fixed Foreign Key dropdown in data grid when foreign key references 2 different tables with same foreign column name in both referenced tables.
- BUGFIX: Fixed tiny memory leak in the import() function.
- BUGFIX: Fixed import() function options parser, so it no longer overwrites import plugin configuration with incorrect types of configuration values (i.e. string 'true' instead of expected boolean).

- BUGFIX: #5083 Improved cell editing behavior, so entering edition with Enter key or mouse Double-Click no longer preselects whole value.
- BUGFIX: #5091 Fixed custom SQL functions editor to prevent duplicated argument names. Also fixed correct argumentName-to-value assignment if arguments share same initial part of their name. Also fixed handling of differnt type of arguments passed to custom SQL function.
- BUGFIX: #5074 #5082 #5083 Fixed cell editing to preselect proper FK value from dropdown, to correctly load cell value if it containts single quote character and to have proper content selection depending on how editing is triggered.
- BUGFIX: #5082 When editing FK value inline (not from dropdown), the autocompleted value also updates selection of item in the dropdown (yet to be shown if user chooses so). This also fixes up/down keyboard navigation basing on autocompleted value.
- BUGFIX: #4959 GitHub Actions Linux build: include qt5-qtwayland to fix segfault in AlmaLinux 9.3 (thanks to @tuffnatty).

- ADDED: Full Foreign Keys altering support - when modifying table, foreign keys will follow table changes.
- ADDED: Support for system tables in table window -> they can be viewed but cannot be modified (SQLite itself prevents that).
- ADDED: Completion hints can suggest columns from Views now.

- ADDED: Context menu option to edit selected cell using BLOB editor, even the cell data size is small.
- ADDED: Databases tree filter, so user can easly find any database (in long list) or any table/index/trigger/view in any open database by entering any piece of its name.
- ADDED: Form view of data has now resizable fields (but only for TEXT, BLOB and similar datatypes), so you can see more data at once instead of scrolling a lot.
- ADDED: Grid row (table data grid or query results grid) can select whole row at once by clicking on ROWNUM column or by Control-click on any cell. (http://bugs.sqlitestudio.pl/?id=208)
- ADDED: An entry in "View" menu to restore last closed window (and one before that and so on), also a configurable keyboard shortcut and entry in taskbar context menu to do the same.
- ADDED: Database list tooltips for databases, so you can quickly view what's the path to database file, what's its size, etc.

- ADDED: Help hint about parameters to SQL function in Custom SQL Functions dialog.
- ADDED: Support for multiple value sets in INSERT statements (introduced in SQLite 3.7.11).
- ADDED: When editing the table cell, all the contents of that cell are selected by default. This can be disabled in configuration dialog.
- ADDED: Context menu command to generate SELECT statement for selected cells (in both data grid and results grid).
- ADDED: Now it's possible to export data from view, just like from a table.
- ADDED: Positional parameters (@, ?, $, :, ...) are now remebered and recalled when used again in same or similar query (with same parameters).
- ADDED: Positional parameters dialog has button to copy the value to other parameters in the dialog that are named exactly the same. The button is displayed only if there are more than one parameter with a certain name.
- ADDED: Context menu for table to erase all data from table (after confirmation).

- CHANGE: Trigger DDL support enhanced. Now it supports "UPDATE OF <columns>" statements.
- CHANGE: Supported languages are now displayed in human readable form, by names, not by strange locale symbols.

- CHANGE: SQL Editor completion hints display "busy" animated icon if parsing some huge SQL takes a little longer.
- CHANGE: Platform detecting code unified.
- CHANGE: Parser and lexer classes enclosed in UniversalParser and UniversalLexer, preventing many potential memory leaks.

- CHANGE: Table grid view menu context reorganized to be more readable.
- CHANGE: Changed icons for "Export table" and "Export database" to fit general schema of icons.
- CHANGE: Enhanced layout of context hints for tables (table data and results data).
- CHANGE: Auto-update checks directory permissions, so it allows automatic update only if privileges are sufficient.
- CHANGE: Session saving now stores the full image of what objects were expanded or collapsed, so it gets fully restored.
- CHANGE: Added shadows for hints under Windows.
