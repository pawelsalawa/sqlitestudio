- BUGFIX: #5091 Fixed custom SQL functions editor to prevent duplicated argument names. Also fixed correct argumentName-to-value assignment if arguments share same initial part of their name. Also fixed handling of differnt type of arguments passed to custom SQL function.
- BUGFIX: #5074 #5082 #5083 Fixed cell editing to preselect proper FK value from dropdown, to correctly load cell value if it containts single quote character and to have proper content selection depending on how editing is triggered.
- BUGFIX: #5082 When editing FK value inline (not from dropdown), the autocompleted value also updates selection of item in the dropdown (yet to be shown if user chooses so). This also fixes up/down keyboard navigation basing on autocompleted value.

If a user keeps lots of gigabytes in a single table and you plan to query it, the user may want to limit amount of rows you query or display at once.

- ADDED: Full Foreign Keys altering support - when modifying table, foreign keys will follow table changes.
- ADDED: Support for system tables in table window -> they can be viewed but cannot be modified (SQLite itself prevents that).
- ADDED: Completion hints can suggest columns from Views now.

- ADDED: Context menu option to edit selected cell using BLOB editor, even the cell data size is small.
- ADDED: Databases tree filter, so user can easly find any database (in long list) or any table/index/trigger/view in any open database by entering any piece of its name.
- ADDED: Form view of data has now resizable fields (but only for TEXT, BLOB and similar datatypes), so you can see more data at once instead of scrolling a lot.
- ADDED: Grid row (table data grid or query results grid) can select whole row at once by clicking on ROWNUM column or by Control-click on any cell. (http://bugs.sqlitestudio.pl/?id=208)
- ADDED: An entry in "View" menu to restore last closed window (and one before that and so on), also a configurable keyboard shortcut and entry in taskbar context menu to do the same.
- ADDED: Database list tooltips for databases, so you can quickly view what's the path to database file, what's its size, etc.

- ADDED: Help hint about parameters to SQL function in Custom SQL Functions dialog.
- ADDED: Support for multiple value sets in INSERT statements (introduced in SQLite 3.7.11).
- ADDED: When editing the table cell, all the contents of that cell are selected by default. This can be disabled in configuration dialog.

- ADDED: Now it's possible to export data from view, just like from a table.
- ADDED: Positional parameters (@, ?, $, :, ...) are now remebered and recalled when used again in same or similar query (with same parameters).
- ADDED: Positional parameters dialog has button to copy the value to other parameters in the dialog that are named exactly the same. The button is displayed only if there are more than one parameter with a certain name.
- ADDED: Context menu for table to erase all data from table (after confirmation).

- CHANGE: Dropped "PRAGMA full_column_names" usage, as it is deprecated SQLite3 interface.
- CHANGE: Editing query results now supports editing results from cross-database queries! The only condition is that columns are selected directly, without expression modifiers, such as math operations, etc.

- CHANGE: Trigger DDL support enhanced. Now it supports "UPDATE OF <columns>" statements.
- CHANGE: Supported languages are now displayed in human readable form, by names, not by strange locale symbols.

- CHANGE: SQL Editor completion hints display "busy" animated icon if parsing some huge SQL takes a little longer.
- CHANGE: Platform detecting code unified.
- CHANGE: Parser and lexer classes enclosed in UniversalParser and UniversalLexer, preventing many potential memory leaks.

- CHANGE: Table grid view menu context reorganized to be more readable.
- CHANGE: Changed icons for "Export table" and "Export database" to fit general schema of icons.
- CHANGE: Enhanced layout of context hints for tables (table data and results data).

- ADDED: Columns order in TableDialog can be now be managed by drag&drop.

- CHANGE: (SQL parser stuff) Smart completion hints - now SQLiteStudio knows better if next argument should be a keyword, or a table name, or index, name, etc. Moreover - object names (tables, indexes, etc) already used somewhere in the SQL query appear higher in completion hint, since user seems to be interested in them. It really kicks ass! Try it out!

- BUGFIX: Triggers created for table are recreated after table is edited.
- BUGFIX: File choosing dialog fixes under Unix (filters updating and <escape> key binding).
