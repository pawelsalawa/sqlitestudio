    </message>
    <message>
      <source>When called without argument, tells the current output format for a query results. When the &lt;mode&gt; is passed, the mode is changed to the given one. Supported modes are:
- CLASSIC - columns are separated by a comma, not aligned,
- FIXED   - columns have equal and fixed width, they always fit into terminal window width, but the data in columns can be cut off,
- COLUMNS - like FIXED, but smarter (do not use with huge result sets, see details below),
- ROW     - each column from the row is displayed in new line, so the full data is displayed.

The CLASSIC mode is recommended if you want to see all the data, but you don&apos;t want to waste lines for each column. Each row will display full data for every column, but this also means, that columns will not be aligned to each other in next rows. The CLASSIC mode also doesn&apos;t respect the width of your terminal (console) window, so if values in columns are wider than the window, the row will be continued in next lines.

The FIXED mode is recommended if you want a readable output and you don&apos;t care about long data values. Columns will be aligned, making the output a nice table. The width of columns is calculated from width of the console window and a number of columns.

The COLUMNS mode is similar to FIXED mode, except it tries to be smart and make columns with shorter values more thin, while columns with longer values get more space. First to shrink are columns with longest headers (so the header names are to be cut off as first), then columns with the longest values are shrinked, up to the moment when all columns fit into terminal window.
ATTENTION! The COLUMNS mode reads all the results from the query at once in order to evaluate column widhts, therefore it is dangerous to use this mode when working with huge result sets. Keep in mind that this mode will load entire result set into memory.

The ROW mode is recommended if you need to see whole values and you don&apos;t expect many rows to be displayed, because this mode displays a line of output per each column, so you&apos;ll get 10 lines for single row with 10 columns, then if you have 10 of such rows, you will get 100 lines of output (+1 extra line per each row, to separate rows from each other).</source>

    <message>
      <source>Prints all objects (tables, indexes, triggers and views) that are in the database as a tree. The tree is very similar to the one that you can see in GUI client of the SQLiteStudio.
When -c option is given, then also columns will be listed under each table.
When -s option is given, then also system objects will be printed (sqlite_* tables, autoincrement indexes, etc).
The database argument is optional and if provided, then only given database will be printed. This is not a registered database name, but instead it&apos;s an internal SQLite database name, like &apos;main&apos;, &apos;temp&apos;, or any attached database name. To print tree for other registered database, call %1 first to switch the working database, and then use %2 command.</source>

What is current working database?
When you type a SQL query to be executed, it is executed on the default database, which is also known as the current working database. Most of database-related commands can also work using default database, if no database was provided in their arguments. The current database is always identified by command line prompt. The default database is always defined (unless there is no database on the list at all).

The default database can be selected in various ways:
- using %1 command,
- by passing database file name to the application startup parameters,
- by passing registered database name to the application startup parameters,
- by restoring previously selected default database from saved configuration,
- or when default database was not selected by any of the above, then first database from the registered databases list becomes the default one.</source>
