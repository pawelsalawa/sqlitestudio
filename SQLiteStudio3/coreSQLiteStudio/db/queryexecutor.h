/**
 * @brief Advanced SQL query execution handler.
 *
 * QueryExecutor is an advanced SQL query execution handler, which lets you execute any query (with subqueries, joins, etc)
 * and is capable of providing meta information about returned data, such as ROWID for all rows and columns,
 * data sources (database, table and column) for every column, rows affected, total rows number for query, etc.
 * All of this available for both SQLite versions: 2 and 3.
 *
 * Queries are executed asynchronously. To handle result a lambda function can be used (or any function pointer),
 * or manual tracking of asynchronous execution ID and signals from this class. Function pointers and lambdas
 * are recommended way to handle results.
 *
 * It also allows you to:
 * <ul>
 * <li>programatically define sorting on desired column.</li>
 * <li>define result rows paging (page size and queried page)</li>
 * <li>refer other databases by their symbolic name and they will be attached and detached on the fly</li>
 * <li>define maximum cell data size (in bytes), so you won't read too much data at once</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Total number of result rows is counted by a separate call to the database (using <tt>SELECT count(*) ...</tt>)
 * and its result is provided later, which is signalized by signal resultsCountingFinished(). Row counting can
 * be disabled with setSkipRowCounting(). See "Counting query" section below for details.
 *
 * The simplest use case would be:
 * @code
 * Db* db = getDb();
 * QueryExecutor *executor = new QueryExecutor(db, "SELECT * FROM table");
 * executor->exec([=](SqlQueryPtr results)
 * {
 *     if (results->isError())
 *     {
 *          qCritical() << "Error " << results->getErrorCode() << ": " << results->getErrorText() << "\n";
 *          return;
 *     }
 *     qDebug() << results->valueList();
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Unless you want some of QueryExecutor's special features, it's recommended to use
 * Db::exec() and Db::asyncExec(), because while QueryExecutor is powerful, it also does lots of thing underneeth
 * you may not need at all.
 *
 * \note This class is used in SQL editor window (SqlQueryModel) to execute queries entered by the user.
 *
 * \section smart_simple_sec "smart mode" vs "simple mode"
 *
 * Documentation of this class references many times to "smart mode" and "simple mode" expressions.
 * The "smart mode" means that the QueryExecutor was able to parse the input query, modify it for its needs
 * (add some meta-information columns, etc) and executed modified query successfully.
 * When the "smart mode" fails (which should be rare), the "simple mode" steps in as a fallback strategy.
 * The "simple mode" doesn't modify input query, just directly executes in on the database
 * and then QueryExecutor tries to extract as much meta-information from "simple mode" as it can (which is not much).
 *
 * The "simple mode" also doesn't apply any paging (see QueryExecutor::setPage()), nor data size limits
 * (see QueryExecutor::setDataLengthLimit()).
 *
 * The meta-information is all the data from the query that is not the essential data requested in the input query.
 * That is full description on all requested columns (their source tables, databases, data types),
 * ROWID value for all returned data rows, and more...
 *
 * \section counting_query Counting query
 *
 * QueryExecutor can split results into pages. In such cases, results are not all read, instead they are limited
 * at SQL level with LIMIT and OFFSET keywords. Because of that it is impossible to tell how many rows
 * would actualy be returned if there were no limit keywords.
 *
 * To deal with it the QueryExecutor makes extra query execution, which happens asynchronously to the main query
 * execution. This extra execution starts just after the main query execution has finished (with success).
 * This extra query (aka "Counting query") is made of original query wrapped with:
 * @code
 * SELECT count(*) FROM (original_query)
 * @endcode
 * This way QueryExecutor know the true number of rows to be retuend by the query.
 *
 * Since this extra query execution takes some extra time, this is performed asynchronously and only after
 * successful execution of the main query. If you need to work with QueryExecutor::getTotalRowsReturned(),
 * wait for the QueryExecutor::resultsCountingFinished() signal first.
 *
 * Row counting query execution can be disabled with QueryExecutor::setSkipRowCounting(),
